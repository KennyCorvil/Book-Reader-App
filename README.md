# Book-Reader-App
In this project I use HTML CSS and JavaScript to create a  book reading web application.

With the this app a user can read books that are in Html format (you can find public domain book on https://www.gutenberg.org/ or convert your own pdf or epub files )

This app provides the ability to search definitions of words by highlighting the word.
I used a free dictionary api https://dictionaryapi.dev/

This app provides the ability to turn the book into audio(TTS)
I use the Window.speechSynthesis API https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/speechSynthesis

This app provides the ability to take note which will be saved in localStorage
definitions of words can also be saved to the notes

A text search and highlight feature is added using MarkJs https://markjs.io/ 
I use Markjs mainly to not reinvent the wheel and also the solutions I came up with were limited and would later cause issues and bugs

Html files can be by drag and drop or by browsing
